# Measurement Conversion Tool

This project provides a tool for converting between different units of measurement (e.g., length, weight, temperature). It includes conversion logic and a test suite to ensure the accuracy of each conversion.

## Project Structure
- `measure.py`: Contains functions to convert between various units such as meters to feet, kilograms to pounds, and Celsius to Fahrenheit.
- `measure_test.py`: A suite of unit tests to validate the functionality of the conversion methods.

## Features
- Convert length units (e.g., meters to feet, inches to centimeters).
- Convert weight units (e.g., kilograms to pounds, grams to ounces).
- Convert temperature units (e.g., Celsius to Fahrenheit, Fahrenheit to Celsius).
